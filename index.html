      <h1>How would you define poverty?</h1>
      <p>The term “poverty” refers to a financial state. The loss of a child due to waterborne sickness is a
        heartbreaking picture of poverty. In addition, poverty is a lack of power, representation and liberty. Those who
        lack even the necessities of life are considered poor. However, there is more to being poor than having limited
        financial resources or a low income.

        Being poor comprises economic, political and social deprivation. Poverty-stricken people don’t get many
        opportunities. Inadequate nutrition, increased disease risk and lack of healthcare and necessities lead to low
        achievement.

        The social determiners of poverty are:
      <ul class="ulLeft">
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Health</li>
        <li>Accessibility to social services</li>
        <li>Vulnerability</li>
        <li>Isolation from society</li>
        <li>Gaining access to the social resources</li>
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h1>Impacts of poverty on children</h1>
      <p>Poverty affects children throughout their lives. As the child ages, the misery and destruction caused by its
        effects intensify.

        It’s hard to rescue a child who’s fallen victim to poverty’s deprivation. However, successful efforts to save
        children from poverty examine the problem as a whole. This is why the child development concept considers the
        children’s physical, social, psychological, economic and spiritual well-being to provide a comprehensive
        solution to the problem of poverty.
      <ul class="ulLeft">
        <li>Poverty affects development and growth physically.</li>

        <li>Poverty inhibits social and emotional growth.</li>
        <li>Poverty reduces the average life span.</li>

        <li>Poverty increases rates of child mortality.</li>

        <li>Poverty raises the likelihood that a child may suf</li>

        <li>Poverty amplifies achievement gaps.</li>

        <li>The stresses of poverty affect parenting skills.</li>

        <li>Poverty exposes children to hunger, neglect, insecurity and instability.</li>

        <li>Children in poverty are more likely to be victims and witnesses to violence.</li>
