        <h2>Shelter For Family</h2>
        <p>Hundreds of homeless people die each year from diseases, untreated medical conditions, lack of nutrition, starvation, and exposure to extreme cold or hot weather. 
          So that's why we are here to help <strong>Needy People.</strong>

        <h2>Education For Childrens</h2>
        <p>Access to education has always been a challenge for under-privileged children. However, due to the pandemic, as livelihoods were affected and many families were further pushed into poverty, children from lower-income groups suffered the most. Only about <strong>28% children</strong> living in rural areas and slums had access to digital learning. Education came to a halt for lakhs of children, who had already been struggling in the pre-pandemic world.</p>

        <h2>Food For Family</h2>
        <p>Food is a basic necessity and having access to it is a right. Imagine going without food for a day. It’s almost <strong>impossible</strong> for us to survive a single day without food and yet, there are so many children who starve for days. The number of people suffering from hunger has dropped but, there are many who do not get the much required nourishment they need to sustain.</p>

      <h1>How would you define poverty?</h1>
      <p>The term “poverty” refers to a financial state. The loss of a child due to waterborne sickness is a
        heartbreaking picture of poverty. In addition, poverty is a lack of power, representation and liberty. Those who
        lack even the necessities of life are considered poor. However, there is more to being poor than having limited
        financial resources or a low income.

        Being poor comprises economic, political and social deprivation. Poverty-stricken people don’t get many
        opportunities. Inadequate nutrition, increased disease risk and lack of healthcare and necessities lead to low
        achievement.

        The social determiners of poverty are:
      <ul class="ulLeft">
        <li>Education</li>
        <li>Health</li>
        <li>Accessibility to social services</li>
        <li>Vulnerability</li>
        <li>Isolation from society</li>
        <li>Gaining access to the social resources</li>
        </p>
      </ul>

      <h1>Impacts of poverty on children</h1>
      <p>Poverty affects children throughout their lives. As the child ages, the misery and destruction caused by its
        effects intensify.

        It’s hard to rescue a child who’s fallen victim to poverty’s deprivation. However, successful efforts to save
        children from poverty examine the problem as a whole. This is why the child development concept considers the
        children’s physical, social, psychological, economic and spiritual well-being to provide a comprehensive
        solution to the problem of poverty.
      <ul class="ulLeft">
        <li>Poverty affects development and growth physically.</li>

        <li>Poverty inhibits social and emotional growth.</li>
        <li>Poverty reduces the average life span.</li>

        <li>Poverty increases rates of child mortality.</li>

        <li>Poverty raises the likelihood that a child may suffer from a chronic illness.</li>
      </ul>
